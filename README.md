# NewsBot: Automated News Summarizer And QnA

 Welcome to "NewsBot", an innovative project that leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically summarize news articles and provide Q&A functionality. This tool is designed to help users quickly grasp the essence of news stories and get answers to their questions based on the article content. 


## Introduction
Our project, "Newsbot," is an AI-driven tool designed to automate the summarization and Q&A generation for news articles. The main technologies we are utilizing include Streamlit for the web interface, the Newspaper3k library for article scraping, and Hugging Face's Transformers library for the summarization and Q&A functionalities. Here's a brief overview of the project workflow:

Article Fetching:
 Users input a URL of a news article, which is then fetched and parsed using the Newspaper3k library.
Summarization: The fetched article text is processed by a pre-trained summarization model from the Transformers library, producing a concise summary.

Q&A Generation:
 Users can ask questions about the summarized article. Our Q&A pipeline, also powered by Transformers, generates answers based on the article's content.   The user interacts with the application through a Streamlit interface. They enter the URL of the news article and can see the summarized version of the article. Additionally, they can input questions related to the article and receive accurate answers generated by the AI model.
